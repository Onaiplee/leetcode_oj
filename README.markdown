All problems are from Online Judge part of http://www.leetcode.com
I solve these problems for two reasons:
1) Prepare for technical interviews
2) For fun

The solutions are given in C++ code.
The comments start with "//" is the original problem text.
The comments start with "/**" and "**/" is my comments on that problem.

I will try to give a complete solution that can directly fit in leetcode
Online Judge. But sometimes I only give the essential part of the code.
If you have any questions about the code, please send me an email.
